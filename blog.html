                                    After a few months of breaks, l'm resuming with an exquisite "Mango Burfi". I'm indeed delighted to resume my food photography experiments from where I left off. Moreover, I have been using handmade backdrops which are always made by me for food styling.
                                    The break became a blessing in disguise that had given me an adequate space to revisit my previous food styling and learnt the flaws that I had made there and every error pushing me to do a better food styling and photography in the future

                                    A tiny snack which takes a great place in Sadhya, that is a banana chip or kaya varathathu.

                                    It is one of my most loved snacks. During my childhood, we bought it from a store. But nowadays we make our own because we got the secret recipe of this crispy banana chips. Usually, we make a bulk amount of chips at a time and store it in a container and used as a teatime snack or every time snacks. This recipe is just as easy as that-thinly sliced raw nendran banana is deep-fried in the coconut oil and seasoned with saltwater, turmeric powder, black pepper and asafoetida.
                                    Let's bring back my college memories. I have two friends from my region. We studied in the same college at Chennai then whenever we come for holidays, my college friends used to request us to bring these bananas chip because it tastes better and they never have the same taste as anywhere. After every holiday, we got the banana chips for there 6.

                                    Since I didn't have a funnel, instead I have used a piping bag. Then carefully pour the batter into the hot oil. The batter should be fried enough until it gets lightly golden brown, then topped with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and edible rose petals or you can use your favourite toppings.

                                    It is highly debatable for an absolute recipe for any new bakes, cake, or dishes.Therefore, everything is born through various experimentations. Thus far, I had hardly stuck with said methods or recipes, but I had experimented with distinctive recipes instead. Again, I've experimented with a new recipe, ignoring the traditional one. Generally, the apple pie hardly garnished with apple, but I have changed the recipe by garnished the apple pie with pomegranate. It was so delicious than the traditional apple pie and never imagined it would come out so perfectly.

                                    My experiments usually start with depending on the stuff we had at home. So, when I notice the fresh cream and pomegranate, it triggered an idea in my mind to do an ice cream rolls. I don't have any prior experience of making ice cream rolls, but, I had a chance to witnessed an ice cream shop. It is fun to watch it doing.But here I don't have any proper utensils to do that.But somehow I could do that with household things and set it in the freezer around eight hours.Then, the next I tried to roll, but it didn't come out properly, and it melted. After That, again I kept it in the freezer, and I made ice cream slices with that.It was a random recipe that turned out to be superb
                                    <br>
                                    Further, I made a blunder here instead of a spoon have used a fork that's made it more awful, but still, I'm okay with what I did in composition. It doesn't matter if we made a blunder on the initial stage, we can learn through it. And every picture teaches you different lessons. I'm improving my photography skills gradually day by day, and food stylist makes me even happier.
